## Contribution Guidelines

Weâ€™ve defined some guidelines to ensure new contributions will enhance the project:

* **Quality**: Code quality should adhere to the Coding style guidelines, with TDD (Test-driven development) approach and proper commit messages and high-quality review.
* **Size**: We propose to have a small pull-requests, regular submission. Larger pull-request are difficult to review and can lead to rejection or request for smaller PR.
* **Maintainability**: If the new feature developed by the contributor require maintenance activity then we may ask you to accept responsibility.
* **Non-duplicative**: If the contribution duplicates feature that already exist or are already in progress, you may ask the contributor to create a design documentation and submit the proposal. Decision on incorporating the proposal is fully on the maintenance team.
